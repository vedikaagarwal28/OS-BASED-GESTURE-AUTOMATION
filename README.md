AirSense, a fully touchless gesture-control OS-Automation that lets users operate a computer without touching the touchpad or keyboard, eliminating any hardware.

 Using MediaPipe-based hand tracking, PyAutoGUI for OS-level automation, advanced gesture recognition, and a custom TCP networking pipeline, the system enables real-time, seamless, and intuitive device control.


Key Features We Include:
• Air Cursor — precise finger-based cursor control
• Gesture Click + Drag/Drop — move files/folders touchlessly
• Two-Finger Scroll — smooth vertical & horizontal scrolling
• Pinch Zoom — natural zoom in/out gestures
• Desktop/App Switching — quick navigation through hand tilts
• Text Selection — highlight & edit without a mouse
• Gesture Screenshot — instant capture with a custom hand pose
• Voice Commands — hands-free app launches & system actions

One of the most striking feature is:
 TCP Networking Mode-
 A camera-equipped COMPUTER A reads hand gestures + voice commands →
 Sends real-time control signals via our custom TCP protocol →
 COMPUTER B executes them instantly.
 This makes AirSense usable across machines, OS setups, or remote   environments.
